                Whenever an email message is received the actions will be run if the condition is met.

                The context for the condition and actions will include a "headers" Map with all of the
                email headers in it (either String, or List of String if there are more than one of the header), a
                "fields" Map with the following: toList, ccList, bccList, from, subject, sentDate, and receivedDate,
                a "flags Map, and a bodyPartList which is a List of Map with info for each body part.

                For a full description of the structure see the org.moqui.EmailServices.process#EmailEca service
                interface. If a single service is used to process the email it should implement this interface.
