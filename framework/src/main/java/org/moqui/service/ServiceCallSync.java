     * - find list and iterate don't cache results (but do filter and add to results aside from limitations below)
     * - EntityListIterator.getPartialList() and iterating through results with next/previous does not add created values
     * - find with DB limit will return wrong number of values if deleted values were in the results
     * - find count doesn't add for created values, subtract for deleted values, and for updates if old matched and new doesn't subtract and vice-versa
     * - view-entities won't work, they don't incorporate results from TX Cache
     * - if a value is created or updated, then a record with FK is created, then the value is updated again commit writes may fail with FK violation (see update() method for other notes)
     * - queries that do for-update may be unreliable as with the TX cache in place we only do a query to lock the value but don't merge the results
