I hereby grant to recipients of software a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in

patent litigation against me or any other entity (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that my Contribution, or the Work to
which I have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
