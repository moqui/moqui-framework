Release 1.6.1 - 24 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.6.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This is the first release after the repository reorganization in Moqui 
Ecosystem. The runtime directory is now in a separate repository. The 
framework build now gets JAR files from Bintray JCenter instead of having
them in the framework/lib directory. Overall the result is a small
foundation with additional libraries, components, etc added as needed using
Gradle tasks.

Build Changes

- Gradle tasks to help handle runtime directory in a separate repository
  from Moqui Framework
- Added component management features as Gradle tasks
  - Components available configured in addons.xml
  - Repositories components come from configured in addons.xml
  - Get component from current or release archive (getCurrent, getRelease)
  - Get component from git repositories (getGit)
  - When getting a component, automatically gets all components it depends
    on (must be configured in addons.xml so it knows where to get them)
  - Do a git pull for moqui, runtime, and all components
- Most JAR files removed, framework build now uses Bintray JCenter
- JAR files are downloaded as needed on build
- For convenience in IDEs to copy JAR files to the framework/dependencies
  directory use: gradle framework:copyDependencies; note that this is not
  necessary in IntelliJ IDEA (will import dependencies when creating a new
  project based on the gradle files, use the refresh button in the Gradle
  tool window to update after updating moqui)
- If your component builds source or runs Spock tests changes will be
  needed, see the runtime/base-component/example/build.gradle file

New Features

- The makeCondition(Map) methods now support _comp entry for comparison
  operator, _join entry for join operator, and _list entry for a list of
  conditions that will be combined with other fields/values in the Map
- In FieldValueCondition if the value is a collection and operator is
  EQUALS set to IN, or if NOT_EQUAL then NOT_IN

Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with EntityFindBase.condition() where condition break down
  set ignore case to true
- Fixed issue with from/thru date where conversion from String was ignored
- Fixed MySQL date-time type for milliseconds; improved example conf for XA
- If there are errors in screen actions the error message is displayed
  instead of rendering the widgets (usually just resulting in more errors)


===========================================================================
Long Term To Do List
===========================================================================

- XML Screens
  - Screen section-iterate pagination
  - Screen form automatic client JS validation for more service in-parameters
    for: number-range, text-length, text-letters, time-range, credit-card.@types
  - Dynamic Screens (database-driven: DynamicScreen* entities)

    http://ehcache.org/generated/2.9.0/html/ehc-all/#page/Ehcache_Documentation_Set%2Fto-srch_searching_a_cache.html%23
- Artifact Execution Facade
  - Call ArtifactExecutionFacade.push() (to track, check authz, etc) for
    other types of artifacts (if/as determined to be helpful), including:
    Component, Webapp, Screen Section, Screen Form, Screen Form Field,
    Template, Script, Entity Field
  - For record-level authz automatically add constraints to queries if
    the query follows an adequate pattern and authz requires it, or fail
    authz if can't add constraint

    - like current but use OData URL structure, query parameters, etc
    - mount on /odata4 as alternative to existing /rest
    - generate EDMX for all entities (and exported services?)
  - Generate minimal Data Document based on changes (per TX possible, runs async so not really; from existing doc, like current ES doc)
  - Update database from Data Document
  - Data Document UI
    - show/edit field, rel alias, condition, link
    - special form for add (edit?) field with 5 drop-downs for relationships, one for field, all updated based on
      master entity and previous selections
  - Data Document REST interface
    - get single by dataDocumentId and PK values for primary entity
    - search through ElasticSearch for those with associated feed/index
    - json-schema, RAML, Swagger API defs
    - generic service for sending Data Document to REST (or other?) end point
  - Service REST API
    - allow mapping DataDocument operations as well
    x Add artifact type for REST Resource, Method
    x Call ArtifactExecutionFacade.push/pop for RestApi calls
    x Setup john.doe user with permissions for root of various APIs
    - Add attribute for resource/method like screen for anonymous and no authz access
    x Add Service REST API for moqui system admin services
  - OAuth2 Support
    - Use Apache Oltu, see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OLTU/OAuth+2.0+Authorization+Server
    - Spec at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
    - http://oltu.apache.org/apidocs/oauth2/reference/org/apache/oltu/oauth2/as/request/package-summary.html

    - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/807
    - Add authz and token transitions in rest.xml
    - Support in Service REST API (and entity/master?)
    - Add examples of auth and service calls using OAuth2
    - Add OAuth2 details in Swagger and RAML files
    - More?

- AS2 Client and Server
  - use OpenAS2 (http://openas2.sourceforge.net, https://github.com/OpenAS2/OpenAs2App)?
  - tie into SystemMessage for send/receive (with AS2 service for send, code to receive SystemMessage from AS2 server)

- Login through Google, Facebook, etc
  - OpenID, SAML, OAuth, ...
  - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/v2.0

- Workflow that manages activity flow with screens and services attached to
  activities, and tasks based on them taking users to defined or automatic
  screen; see BonitaSoft.com Open Source BPM for similar concept; generally
  workflow without requiring implementation of an entire app once the
  workflow itself is defined

- User Notification
  - WebSocket clients: track userId, notificationName, connectionKey
    - Entity (no, keep in memory): VisitClient - visitId*, userId*, topic*, connectionKey*
    - when sending out WebSocket messages lookup all active Visits for userId and send to each connectionKey
    - API (with at least an example transition) for WebSocket client registry; set connectionKey on current Visit
    - use Camel WebSocket? jWebSocket? (how to send message to client connection key)
    - after more research candidates are (no jWebSocket because it is huge and messy):
      * java_websocket: smallest (90k), no dependencies on other libraries (like Tomcat or Jetty WS), very simple
        library so no authc, no pubsub; has JS library for JS client and Flash SWF file for browsers with no WebSocket
      - Atmosphere: med size (460k), supports variety of transports, but no internal WebSocket (relies on Tomcat, Jetty,
        etc websocket impls), has pubsub model and sessions built-in, but questionable authc facility
  x Manual notification:
    x API pass in notificationName, Map message, userGroupId, boolean queue (true: queue if not connected, false: only send if connected)
    x API to get all outstanding notifications
    x Entity: NotificationMessage - notificationMessageId*, topic, userGroupId, messageJson (from message Map)
    x Entity: NotificationMessageUser - notificationMessageId*, userId*, sentDate, receivedDate
  - Add Moqui Conf XML elements to configure NotificationMessageListener classes
  - Listener for Email with XML Screen to layout (and try out using JSON documents as nested Maps from a screen)
    - where to configure the email and screen to use? use EmailTemplate/emailTemplateId, but where to specify?
      - for notifications from DataFeeds can add DataFeed.emailTemplateId (or not, what about toAddresses, etc?)
      - maybe have a more general way to configure details of topics, including emailTemplateId and screenLocation...

- Data Document and Feed
  - API (or service?) push outstanding data changes (registration/connection, time trigger; tie to SystemMessage)
  - API (or service?) receive/persist data change messages - going reverse of generation for DataDocuments... should be interesting
  - Consumer System Registry
    - feed transport (for each: supports confirmation?)
      - WebSocket (use Notification system, based on notificationName (and userId?))
  - Service to send email from DataFeed (ie receive#DataFeed implementation), use XML Screen for email content
    - don't do this directly, do through NotificationMessage, ie the next item... or maybe not, too many parameters for
      email from too many places related to a DataDocument, may not be flexible enough and may be quite messy
  - Service (receive#DataFeed impl) to send documents as User NotificationMessages (one message per DataDocument); this
    is probably the best way to tie a feed to WebSocket notifications for data updates
    - Use the dataFeedId as the NotificationMessage topic
    - Use this in HiveMind to send notifications of project, task, and wiki changes (maybe?)
