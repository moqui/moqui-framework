Moqui Framework Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 2.0.0 - TBD
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 2.0.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release, with
various non backward compatible API and other changes.

TODO

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- Java JDK 8 now required for running executable WAR
- No longer using Winstone embedded web server (now using Jetty)
- Caching
  - Ehcache has been removed
  - The org.moqui.context.Cache interface is replaced by javax.cache.Cache
  - Configuration options for caches changed (moqui-conf.cache-list.cache)
- Async Services
  - Now uses more standard java.util.concurrent interfaces
  - Removed ServiceCallAsync.maxRetry() - was never supported
  - Removed ServiceCallAsync.persist() - was never supported well, used to
    simply call through Quartz Scheduler when set
  - Removed persist option from XML Actions service-call.@async attribute
  - Async services never called through Quartz Scheduler (only scheduled)
  - ServiceCallAsync.callWaiter() replaced by callFuture()
  - Removed ServiceCallAsync.resultReceiver()
  - Removed ServiceResultReceiver interface - use callFuture() instead
  - Removed ServiceResultWaiter class - use callFuture() instead
  - See related new features below
- Removed ServiceSemaphore entity, now using ServiceParameterSemaphore
- Deprecated methods
  - These methods were deprecated (usually by methods with shorter names)
    long ago and with other API changes now removing them
  - Removed getLocalizedMessage() and formatValue() from L10nFacade
  - Removed runScriptInCurrentContext(), evaluateCondition(),
    evaluateContextField(), and evaluateStringExpand() from ResourceFacade
- ArtifactHit and ArtifactHitBin now use same artifact type enum as
  ArtifactAuthz, for efficiency and consistency; configuration of
  artifact-stats by sub-type no longer supported, had little value and
  caused performance overhead
- When updating to this version recommend stopping all instances in a
  cluster before starting any instance with the new version

New Features

- Now using Jetty embedded for the executable WAR instead of Winstone
  - initially Jetty version 9.3.8.v20160314
  - this version of Jetty requires Java 8
  - now internally using Servlet API 3.1.0
- Various library updates, big cleanup of classes found in multiple jar
  files (JarHell checks pass; nice in general, needed for ElasticSearch)
- Caching
  - CacheFacade now supports separate local and distributed caches both
    using the javax.cache interfaces
  - Added new MCache class for faster local-only caches
    - implements the javax.cache.Cache interface
    - supports expire by create, access, update
    - supports custom expire on get
    - supports max entries, eviction done in separate thread
  - For distributed caches now using Hazelcast, initially version 3.6.2
  - Hazelcast can be used for distributed entity cache and can be used for
    web session replication, distributed execution, and OrientDB clustering
  - Set many entities to cache=never to avoid overhead of caching where
    read/write ratio doesn't justify it or where cache could cause issues
- Async Services
  - ServiceCallAsync now using standard java.util.concurrent interfaces
  - Use callFuture() to get a Future object instead of callWaiter()
  - Can now get Runnable or Callable objects to run a service through a
    ExecutorService of your choice
  - Services can now be called local or distributed through Hazelcast
    - Added ServiceCallAsync.distribute() method
    - Added distribute option to XML Actions service-call.@async attribute
  - Distributed services allow offloading service execution to worker nodes
- Added default Hazelcast web session replication config (see web.xml)
- Implemented distributed entity cache invalidate using a Hazelcast Topic,
  enabled in Moqui Conf XML file with the @distributed-cache-invalidate
  attribute on the entity-facade element
- Added ADMIN_PASSWORD permission for administrative password change
  (in UserServices.update#Password service)
- Added UserServices.enable#UserAccount service to enable disabled account
- EntityDataWriter now supports export with a entity master definition
  name, applied only to entities exported that have a master def with the
  given master name
- Added support for error screens rendered depending on type of error
  - configured in the webapp.error-screen element in Moqui Conf XML file
  - if error screen render fails sends original error response
  - this is custom content that avoids sending an error response
- A component may now have a MoquiConf.xml file that overrides the default
  configuration file (MoquiDefaultConf.xml from the classpath) but is
  overridden by the runtime configuration file; the MoquiConf.xml file in
  each component is merged into the main conf based on the component
  dependency order (logged on startup)

Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with REST and other JSON request body parameters where single
  entry lists were unwrapped to just the entry by the canonicalization code
- Fixed NPE in EntityFind.oneMaster() when the master value isn't found,
  now returns null with no error; fixes moqui-runtime issue #18
- Fixed ElFinder rm (moqui-runtime GitHub issue #23), response for upload
- Screen sub-content directories treated as not found so directory entries
  not listed (GitHub moqui-framework issue #47)
- In entity cache auto clear for list of view-entity fixed mapping of
  member entity fields to view entity alias, and partial match when only
  some view entity fields are on a member entity
- Cache clear fix for view-entity list cache fixes issue where adding a
  permission required manual cache clear or restart for permission to apply

===========================================================================
Release 1.6.2 - 26 Mar 2016
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.6.2 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This release is all about performance improvements, bug fixes, library
updates and cleanups. There are a number of minor new features like better
multi-tenant handling (and security), optionally loading data on start if
the DB is empty, more flexible handling of runtime Moqui Conf XML location,
database support and transaction management, and so on.

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- Entity field types are somewhat more strict for database operations; this
  is partly for performance reasons and partly to avoid database errors
  that happen only on certain databases (ie some allow passing a String for
  a Timestamp, others don't; now you have to use a Timestamp or other date
  object); use EntityValue.setString or similar methods to do data
  conversions higher up
- Removed the TenantCurrency, TenantLocale, TenantTimeZone, and
  TenantCountry entities; they aren't generally used and better not to have
  business settings in these restricted technical config entities

New Features

- Many performance improvements based on profiling; cached entities finds
  around 6x faster, non cached around 3x; screen rendering also faster
- Added JDBC Connection stash by tenant, entity group, and transaction,
  can be disabled with transaction-facade.@use-connection-stash=false in
  the Moqui Conf XML file
- Many code cleanups and more CompileStatic with XML handling using new
  MNode class instead of Groovy Node; UserFacadeImpl and
  TransactionFacadeImpl much cleaner with internal classes for state
- Added tools.@empty-db-load attribute with data file types to load on
  startup (through webapp ContextListener init only) if the database is
  empty (no records for moqui.basic.Enumeration)
- If the moqui.conf property (system property, command line, or in
  MoquiInit.properties) starts with a forward slash ('/') it is now
  considered an absolute path instead of relative to the runtime directory
  allowing a conf file outside the runtime directory (an alternative
  to using ../)
- UserAccount.userId and various other ID fields changed from id-long to id
  as userId is only an internal/sequenced ID now, and for various others
  the 40 char length changed years ago is more than adequate; existing
  columns can be updated for the shorter length, but don't have to be
- Changes to run tests without example component in place (now a component
  separate from moqui-runtime), using the moqui.test and other entities
- Added run-jackrabbit option to run Apache Jackrabbit locally when Moqui
  starts and stop is when Moqui stops, with conf/etc in runtime/jackrabbit
- Added SubscreensDefault entity and supporting code to override default
  subscreens by tenant and/or condition with database records
- Now using the VERSION_2_3_23 version for FreeMarker instead of a
  previous release compatibility version
- Added methods to L10nFacade that accept a Locale when something other
  than the current user's locale is needed
- Added TransactionFacade runUseOrBegin() and runRequireNew() methods to
  run code (in a Groovy Closure) in a transaction
- ArtifactHit/Bin persistence now done in a worker thread instead of async
  service; uses new eci.runInWorkerThread() method, may be added
  ExecutionContext interface in the future
- Added XML Form text-line.depends-on element so autocomplete fields can
  get data on the client from other form fields and clear on change
- Improved encode/decode handling for URL path segments and parameters
- Service parameters with allow-html=safe are now accepted even with
  filtered elements and attributes, non-error messages are generated and
  the clean HTML from AntiSamy is used
- Now using PegDown for Markdown processing instead of Markdown4J
- Multi Tenant
  - Entity find and CrUD operations for entities in the tenantcommon group
    are restricted to the DEFAULT instance, protects REST API and so on
    regardless of admin permissions a tenant admin might assign
  - Added tenants allowed on SubscreensItem entity and subscreens-item
    element, makes more sense to filter apps by tenant than in screen
  - Improvements to tenant provisioning services, new MySQL provisioning,
    and enable/disable tenant services along with enable check on switch
  - Added ALL_TENANTS option for scheduled services, set on system
    maintenance services in quartz_data.xml by default; runs the service
    for each known tenant (by moqui.tenant.Tenant records)
- Entity Facade
  - DB meta data (create tables, etc) and primary sequenced ID queries now
    use a separate thread to run in a different transaction instead of
    suspend/resume as some databases have issues with that, especially
    nested which happens when service and framework code suspends
- Service Facade
  - Added separateThread option to sync service call as an alternative to
    requireNewTransaction which does a suspend/resume, runs service in a
    separate thread and waits for the service to complete
  - Added service.@semaphore-parameter attribute which creates a distinct
    semaphore per value of that parameter
  - Services called with a ServiceResultWaiter now get messages passed
    through from the service job in the current MessageFacade (through
    the MessageFacadeException), better handling for other Throwable
  - Async service calls now run through lighter weight worker thread pool
    if persist not set (if persist set still through Quartz Scheduler)
- Dynamic (SPA) browser features
  - Added screen element when render screen to support macros at the screen
    level, such as code for components and services in Angular 2
  - Added support for render mode extension (like .html, .js, etc) to
    last screen name in screen path (or URL), uses the specified
    render-mode and doesn't try to render additional subscreens
  - Added automatic actions.json transition for all screens, runs actions
    and returns results as JSON for use in client-side template rendering
  - Added support for .json extension to transitions, will run the
    transition and if the response goes to another screen returns path to
    that screen in a list and parameters for it, along with
    messages/errors/etc for client side routing between screens

Bug Fixes

- DB operations for sequenced IDs, service semaphores, and DB meta data are
  now run in a separate thread instead of tx suspend/resume as some
  databases have issues with suspend/resume, especially multiple
  outstanding suspended transactions
- Fixed issue with conditional default subscreen URL caching
- Internal login from login/api key and async/scheduled services now checks
  for disabled accounts, expired passwords, etc just like normal login
- Fixed issue with entity lists in TransactionCache, were not cloned so
  new/updated records changed lists that calling code might use
- Fixed issue with cached entity lists not getting cleared when a record is
  updated that wasn't in a list already in the cache but that matches its
  condition
- Fixed issue with cached view-entity lists not getting cleared on new or
  updated records; fixes issues with new authz, tarpits and much more not
  applied immediately
- Fixed issue with cached view-entity one results not getting cleared when
  a member entity is updated (was never implemented)
- Entities in the tenantcommon group no longer available for find and CrUD
  operations outside the DEFAULT instance (protect tenant data)
- Fixed issue with find one when using a Map as a condition that may
  contain non-PK fields and having an artifact authz filter applied, was
  getting non-PK fields and constraining query when it shouldn't
  (inconsistent with previous behavior)
- Fixed ElasticSearch automatic mappings where sub-object mappings always
  had just the first property
- Fixed issues with Entity DataFeed where cached DataDocument mappings per
  entity were not consistent and no feed was done for creates
- Fixed safe HTML service parameters (allow-html=safe), was issue loading
  antisamy-esapi.xml though ESAPI so now using AntiSamy directly
- Fixed issues with DbResource reference move and other operations
- Fixed issues with ResourceReference operations and wiki page updates


===========================================================================
Release 1.6.1 - 24 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.6.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This is the first release after the repository reorganization in Moqui 
Ecosystem. The runtime directory is now in a separate repository. The 
framework build now gets JAR files from Bintray JCenter instead of having
them in the framework/lib directory. Overall the result is a small
foundation with additional libraries, components, etc added as needed using
Gradle tasks.

Build Changes

- Gradle tasks to help handle runtime directory in a separate repository
  from Moqui Framework
- Added component management features as Gradle tasks
  - Components available configured in addons.xml
  - Repositories components come from configured in addons.xml
  - Get component from current or release archive (getCurrent, getRelease)
  - Get component from git repositories (getGit)
  - When getting a component, automatically gets all components it depends
    on (must be configured in addons.xml so it knows where to get them)
  - Do a git pull for moqui, runtime, and all components
- Most JAR files removed, framework build now uses Bintray JCenter
- JAR files are downloaded as needed on build
- For convenience in IDEs to copy JAR files to the framework/dependencies
  directory use: gradle framework:copyDependencies; note that this is not
  necessary in IntelliJ IDEA (will import dependencies when creating a new
  project based on the gradle files, use the refresh button in the Gradle
  tool window to update after updating moqui)
- If your component builds source or runs Spock tests changes will be
  needed, see the runtime/base-component/example/build.gradle file

New Features

- The makeCondition(Map) methods now support _comp entry for comparison
  operator, _join entry for join operator, and _list entry for a list of
  conditions that will be combined with other fields/values in the Map
- In FieldValueCondition if the value is a collection and operator is
  EQUALS set to IN, or if NOT_EQUAL then NOT_IN

Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with EntityFindBase.condition() where condition break down
  set ignore case to true
- Fixed issue with from/thru date where conversion from String was ignored
- Fixed MySQL date-time type for milliseconds; improved example conf for XA
- If there are errors in screen actions the error message is displayed
  instead of rendering the widgets (usually just resulting in more errors)


===========================================================================

- Workflow that manages activity flow with screens and services attached to
  activities, and tasks based on them taking users to defined or automatic
  screen; see BonitaSoft.com Open Source BPM for similar concept; generally
  workflow without requiring implementation of an entire app once the
  workflow itself is defined

- Interesting JS plugins
  - http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
  - http://www.datatables.net
  - http://www.datatables.net/examples/data_sources/server_side.html
  - http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/
  - http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin

- User Notification
  - WebSocket clients: track userId, notificationName, connectionKey
    - Entity (no, keep in memory): VisitClient - visitId*, userId*, topic*, connectionKey*
    - when sending out WebSocket messages lookup all active Visits for userId and send to each connectionKey
    - API (with at least an example transition) for WebSocket client registry; set connectionKey on current Visit
    - use Camel WebSocket? jWebSocket? (how to send message to client connection key)
    - after more research candidates are (no jWebSocket because it is huge and messy):
      * java_websocket: smallest (90k), no dependencies on other libraries (like Tomcat or Jetty WS), very simple
        library so no authc, no pubsub; has JS library for JS client and Flash SWF file for browsers with no WebSocket
      - Atmosphere: med size (460k), supports variety of transports, but no internal WebSocket (relies on Tomcat, Jetty,
        etc websocket impls), has pubsub model and sessions built-in, but questionable authc facility
  x Manual notification:
    x API pass in notificationName, Map message, userGroupId, boolean queue (true: queue if not connected, false: only send if connected)
    x API to get all outstanding notifications
    x Entity: NotificationMessage - notificationMessageId*, topic, userGroupId, messageJson (from message Map)
    x Entity: NotificationMessageUser - notificationMessageId*, userId*, sentDate, receivedDate
  - Add Moqui Conf XML elements to configure NotificationMessageListener classes
  - Listener for Email with XML Screen to layout (and try out using JSON documents as nested Maps from a screen)
    - where to configure the email and screen to use? use EmailTemplate/emailTemplateId, but where to specify?
      - for notifications from DataFeeds can add DataFeed.emailTemplateId (or not, what about toAddresses, etc?)
      - maybe have a more general way to configure details of topics, including emailTemplateId and screenLocation...

- Data Document and Feed
  - API (or service?) push outstanding data changes (registration/connection, time trigger; tie to SystemMessage)
  - API (or service?) receive/persist data change messages - going reverse of generation for DataDocuments... should be interesting
  - Consumer System Registry
    - feed transport (for each: supports confirmation?)
      - WebSocket (use Notification system, based on notificationName (and userId?))
  - Service to send email from DataFeed (ie receive#DataFeed implementation), use XML Screen for email content
    - don't do this directly, do through NotificationMessage, ie the next item... or maybe not, too many parameters for
      email from too many places related to a DataDocument, may not be flexible enough and may be quite messy
  - Service (receive#DataFeed impl) to send documents as User NotificationMessages (one message per DataDocument); this
    is probably the best way to tie a feed to WebSocket notifications for data updates
    - Use the dataFeedId as the NotificationMessage topic
    - Use this in HiveMind to send notifications of project, task, and wiki changes (maybe?)

- Angular 2 Apps
  - support by screen + subscreens, or enable/disable for all apps (with separate webroot or something)?
  - update bootstrap (maybe get from CDN instead of including in source...)
  - for screen generate
    - component.ts file
    - service.ts/js file with:
      - service for each transition
      - service to get data for screen actions
      - services for section actions
      - services for form row actions
    - component.html file (use 'templateUrl' in Component annotation instead of 'template')
    - or use single JS file with component, embedded template (use template: and not templateUrl:), transition services?
  - with system.js need to transpile in the browser?
    - can transpile into JS file using typescript4j; or generate component.js
    - https://github.com/martypitt/typescript4j

- Hazelcast-based improvements
  - configuration for 'microservice' deployments, partitioning services to run on particular servers in a cluster and
    not others (partition groups or other partition feature?)
  - can use for reliable WAN service calls like needed for EntitySync?
    - ie to a remote cluster
    - different from commercial only WAN replication feature
    - would be nice for reliable message queue
  - Quartz Scheduler
    - can use Hazelcast for scheduled service execution in a cluster, perhaps something on top of, underneath, or instead of Quartz Scheduler?
    - consider using Hazelcast as a Quartz JobStore, ie: https://github.com/FlavioF/quartz-scheduler-hazelcast-jobstore
  - DB (or ElasticSearch?) MapStore for persisted (backed up) Hazelcast maps
    - use MapStore and MapLoader interfaces
    - see http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#loading-and-storing-persistent-data
    - https://github.com/mozilla-metrics/bagheera-elasticsearch
      - older, useful only as a reference for implementing something like this in Moqui
    - best to implement something using the EntityFacade for easier configuration, etc
    - see JDBC, etc samples: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/distributed-map/mapstore/src/main/java
  - Persisted Queue for Async Services, etc
    - use QueueStore interface
    - see http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#queueing-with-persistent-datastore
    - use DB?

============
To help with the general issue of overly complex list forms with stacked fields in columns:

- add form-list option to select with columns to display, a setting saved per user
- use form-list.form-list-column elements for default value, i.e. if no saved values for screen location, form name, and userId
- in data structure support specifying which column a field should go in, and in which order in that column (by index/sequence fields)
- in first pass just use check boxes to show/hide columns, in future expand widget to allow dragging fields under
  columns for multiples and order changing

- add option to put header-field fields in popup window instead of header, and in that popup include all fields
  regardless of whether set to display or not

- put buttons for popup in row along with pagination widgets
- add indicator (asterisk or something) when filters are in place
- in dialog, or in another row in the header, show all current filters with an X by each to remove that filter
  (current page link with all parameters except the one in question removed; also remove pageIndex parameter)

============
- Use Jetty instead of Winstone for embedded web server
- Build WebSocket interface for Moqui NotificationMessage interfaces, use javax.websocket as much as possible
  (run initially on Jetty but be able to support other WebSocket libraries)
- Send updates by NotificationMessage to browser for messages, calendar events, tasks (MyAccount stuff)
- Prototype for background process notifications, to be used for various things but start with Payroll run
  (have page return immediately, send notification when done)
