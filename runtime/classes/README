Put classpath resources such as configuration files and such here to
override resources with matching paths elsewhere on the classpath. This
is best supported when running Moqui using the executable WAR file and when
using the Ant add-runtime target or the Gradle addRuntime task to create a
WAR file with the runtime directory embedded. When deploying the Moqui WAR
file in a Servlet container without an embedded runtime directory this may
not work because the classpath is handled differently.

This is especially useful for overriding the default configuration files in
the moqui/framework/src/main/resources directory. Simply copy them to your
runtime/classes directory and make changes as desired.
