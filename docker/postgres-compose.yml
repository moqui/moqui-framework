# A Docker Compose application with Moqui, Postgres, OpenSearch, OpenSearch Dashboards, and virtual hosting through
# nginx-proxy supporting multiple moqui instances on different hostnames.

# Run with something like this for detached mode:
# $ docker compose -f postgres-compose.yml -p moqui up -d
# Or to copy runtime directories for mounted volumes, set default settings, etc use something like this:
# $ ./compose-run.sh postgres-compose.yml
# This sets the project/app name to 'moqui' and the network will be 'moqui_default', to be used by external moqui containers

# Test locally by adding the virtual host to /etc/hosts or with something like:
# $ curl -H "Host: moqui.local" localhost/Login

# To run an additional instance of moqui run something like this (but with
# many more arguments for volume mapping, db setup, etc):
# $ docker run -e VIRTUAL_HOST=moqui2.local --name moqui2_local --network moqui_default moqui

# To import data from the docker host using port 5432 mapped for 127.0.0.1 only use something like this:
# $ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U moqui -W moqui < pg-dump.sql
